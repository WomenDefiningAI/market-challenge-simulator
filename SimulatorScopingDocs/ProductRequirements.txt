Market Entry Strategy Simulator – PRD
1. Overview
Product Name: Market Entry Strategy Simulator
Purpose:
Empower business strategists, product managers, and entrepreneurs to brainstorm, evaluate, and categorize potential solutions for a market challenge. The simulator uses multi-step LLM prompts to generate high-impact solutions, define user personas, and assess solution risk and success factors.

Scope:

Frontend: A Next.js (or similar) single-page web application with minimal input fields and a dynamic results dashboard.

Backend: Serverless API routes or minimal backend logic that orchestrates multiple OpenAI calls, aggregates data, and returns structured results to the frontend.

LLM Integration: Uses user-provided OpenAI API key for prompt execution.

2. Key Objectives & Success Criteria
Rapid Ideation: Quickly generate 10 potential high-impact solutions for the user’s market challenge.

Persona Analysis: Create 6 user personas (3 existing customer personas + 3 new customer personas) to evaluate each solution’s risk and potential.

Risk & Success Categorization: Classify solutions into “Most Risky Bet,” “Most Likely to Succeed,” and “Wildcard” to aid strategic decision-making.

Clear, Actionable Output: Present final analysis in a user-friendly dashboard, with persona-based feedback for each solution.

Success Metrics:

User Engagement: Number of completed simulations, time spent reviewing solutions.

Solution Quality: Positive user feedback on the relevance and usefulness of generated solutions.

Performance: End-to-end simulation completion under an acceptable time (e.g., < 30 seconds).

Adoption: Repeated usage by the same user or broad usage across multiple stakeholders.

3. User Stories
As a Business Strategist:
I want to see a variety of potential solutions to a market challenge, so I can select and refine the best ideas to implement.

As a Product Manager:
I want to understand different user personas and their perceptions of each solution, so I can prioritize features and messaging.

As a Startup Founder:
I want quick, AI-driven insights on how risky or successful each solution might be, so I can make informed decisions with limited resources.

4. Flow & Logic
4.1. Step-by-Step Process
User Input Page (Already Built)

Fields: Company Information, Market Challenge, OpenAI API Key.

Action: “Run Simulation” button triggers the multi-step simulation flow.

Generate 10 Potential High-Impact Solutions

Prompt:

less
Copy
You are a market strategist. Given the following:
- Company Details: [User’s Input]
- Market Challenge: [User’s Input]

Brainstorm 10 high-impact solutions that address this challenge.
Backend/LLM Logic:

Receive user inputs.

Construct the composite prompt.

Call OpenAI API with the user’s API key.

Return the 10 solutions to the frontend.

UI:

Show a progress indicator: “Brainstorming 10X solutions…”

After success, briefly display: “Running solutions through simulations to assess scenarios & user feedback…”

Generate 6 User Personas (3 Current + 3 New)

Prompt:

sql
Copy
Based on the company details and the new solutions,
create 6 user personas:
  - 3 personas representing current customers
  - 3 personas representing new customer segments
Provide a one-line description of each persona’s profile and how they might react to the new solutions.
Backend/LLM Logic:

Construct persona prompt.

Call OpenAI with user’s API key.

Return the 6 personas to the frontend.

UI:

Progress indicator: “Simulating user personas…”

After success, display: “Generating final solutions analysis…”

Persona Feedback & Risk Analysis

Objective: For each of the 10 solutions, gather persona-specific feedback and compute a risk score.

Approach:

Iterative LLM Calls: For each solution, ask the LLM to generate feedback from each persona and a numeric risk score (0–100%).

yaml
Copy
For the following solution: [Solution #]
Given the following personas:
- Persona 1: [Description]
- Persona 2: [Description]
...
Provide:
1. A one-line feedback from each persona.
2. A risk score (0–100%) reflecting how risky this solution is.
Data Aggregation: Summarize each solution’s feedback and average risk score.

Example formula: Average Risk = (Risk_Persona1 + Risk_Persona2 + ... + Risk_Persona6) / 6.

Categorize Solutions

Logic:

Most Risky Bet: Highest average risk score.

Most Likely to Succeed: Lowest average risk score or highest “success” indicator.

Wildcard: Highest variance or mixed persona feedback.

Optional LLM Summarization: Provide final summary prompt to confirm categorization:

diff
Copy
Here are the solutions, their average risk, and persona feedback.
Please categorize them as:
- Most Risky Bet
- Most Likely to Succeed
- Wildcard
Provide a one-line rationale for each categorization.
UI:

Show final results with 3 highlighted solutions (risky, likely, wildcard) and a list of all solutions for further exploration.

5. Detailed Features & UI Components
Progress Indicators

Show transitions for each step:

“Brainstorming 10X solutions…”

“Running solutions through simulations…”

“Simulating user personas…”

“Generating final solutions analysis…”

Final Results Dashboard

High-Level Summary: Summarize the 10 solutions, highlight the top 3 categories.

Detailed View: For each solution, display:

Title/Brief Description

Average Risk Score (0–100%)

Persona Feedback (one line per persona)

Categorized Sections:

Most Risky Bet

Most Likely to Succeed

Wildcard

Expandable Panels or a table layout to allow users to click on any solution and see more details (including each persona’s feedback).

Export Option (Future Enhancement)

Provide an export button to download the final analysis as a PDF or CSV.

6. Constraints & Dependencies
OpenAI API:

Requires user’s own API key; must handle rate limits and potential errors.

Must ensure prompts remain within token limits.

No Persistent Storage (initially):

Data is ephemeral; no user authentication or saved sessions.

If usage grows, consider storing user scenarios in a database for historical reference.

Performance:

Multiple sequential LLM calls (especially for 10 solutions x 6 personas = up to 60 sub-calls) could lead to noticeable wait times.

Could mitigate by parallelizing calls or summarizing in fewer total prompts.

7. Error Handling & Edge Cases
Invalid API Key: Prompt user to re-enter a valid key.

Excessive Token Usage: Break down large prompts into smaller ones or reduce the detail.

LLM Timeout or Rate Limit: Show a user-friendly message, possibly re-try.

No Solutions Returned: Provide fallback messaging if the LLM fails or returns incomplete data.

8. Future Enhancements
Advanced Configuration: Allow users to tweak risk scoring method or prompt parameters (temperature, max tokens).

Interactive “What-If”: Let users modify solutions or persona details mid-simulation and re-run.

Additional Segmentation: Generate more refined personas or competitor analysis.

Authentication & Persistence: Let users save or revisit past simulations in a secure environment.

9. Timeline & Milestones
Milestone 1: Basic UI & Single-Prompt Flow

Implement user input form (already done).

Milestone 2: Persona Generation & Risk Analysis

Implement persona creation step.

Collect risk scores and persona feedback for each solution.

Milestone 3: Categorization & Final Dashboard

Aggregate data, highlight risky/likely/wildcard solutions.

Build final results UI.

Milestone 4: Polishing & Error Handling
