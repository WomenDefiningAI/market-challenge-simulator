- **User-Friendly Experience:** Provide a simple interface with minimal inputs, focusing on a rich simulation experience.
- **Actionable Insights:** Deliver clear, comprehensive simulation outputs that include consumer segmentation, adoption trends, competitive analysis, and strategic advice.

## 3. Key Features
- **Input Interface:**
  - **OpenAI API Key:** A secure field for users to input their API key.
  - **Current Company Information:** A free-form text box to describe the company’s core business, size, and funding status.
  - **New Market Challenge Description:** A free-form text box to detail the new market entry opportunity or challenge.
  
- **Multi-Step Simulation Engine:**
  - **Step 1: Composite Prompt Generation:**  
    The system combines company details and market challenge into a composite prompt instructing the LLM to act as a market research analyst.
  - **Step 2: Consumer Segmentation and Initial Insights:**  
    The LLM generates a high-level overview including segmentation of consumers (e.g., early adopters, price-sensitive, quality-focused) and outlines initial market trends.
  - **Step 3: Iterative Deep-Dive per Segment:**  
    For each consumer segment identified, the system issues follow-up prompts to generate detailed behavior predictions, adoption curves, and tailored strategic recommendations.
  - **Aggregation:**  
    The system collates the outputs into a unified, actionable simulation report.

- **Results Visualization and Reporting:**
  - **Interactive Dashboard:**  
    A dashboard to display the overall simulation summary and allow drill-downs into individual consumer segment details.
  - **Visual Aids:**  
    Use of simple charts or graphs (e.g., adoption curves, segment distribution) to enhance understanding.
  - **Export Options:**  
    Ability to download the simulation results as a PDF or Excel report.
